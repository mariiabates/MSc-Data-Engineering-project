       "  'content': 'Microsoft will reveal its plans for Games with Gold September 2022 before the end of the current month, including the final Xbox 360 titles that will be given away for free. September looks set to be the final month that fans receive four free games instead of two, and it’s unclear if the tech giant plans on changing anything else with its giveaways heading into October. The good news is that September will still feature four games in total, and here’s when fans can expect those new titles to arrive.

This means that the news will likely be shared early next week, and is guaranteed to drop before September 1. This is the date when the first two Games with Gold games from the lineup will be launched, with a total of four being released over the coming weeks. Two of those titles will be sourced from Xbox One and the others from Xbox 360. A good time > winning pic.twitter.com/058Va2KefG— Xbox (@Xbox) August 20, 2022 However, in October, these older titles will be removed from the overall lineup, with Microsoft confirming that they can no longer provide fresh titles for the service due to the limitation of the tech on their remaining game catalogue. Xbox One titles will continue to be featured, with an Xbox announcement explaining: “Games with Gold will continue to include exciting Xbox One titles and exclusive savings each month.” The normal release schedule will be followed in September 2022, with new games going live on the following dates: First Xbox One Game: Available September 1 to 31Second Xbox One Game: Available September 16 to October 15First Xbox 360 Game: Available September 1 to 15Second Xbox 360 Game: Available September 16 to 31. There have been no leaks suggesting what might be included, and there is no reason to believe that any surprise Xbox Series X titles will be thrown into the mix. Most of the biggest games are saved for Xbox Game Pass, and without any substantial insider leaks, we don’t know what is coming next.

       "  'content': \"Former dual-weight champion Henry Cejudo was quickly made to pay after calling Leon Edwards ‘easy money’ during his main event match-up with Kamaru Usman at UFC 278 on Saturday night. ‘Rocky’ became just the second British fighter in UFC history to hold a world title after he sensationally knocked out Usman in the fifth and final round in Salt Lake City. Edwards landed a massive head kick in the last round of his title fight with Usmangetty Despite starting well in the fight, Edwards seemed destined for a second defeat to ‘The Nigerian Nightmare’. Usman was just one minute away from a unanimous decision win before disaster struck and he was knocked out cold by a head kick. Just moments before that happened, ‘The King of Cringe’, turned to Ali Abdelaziz, who manages both him and Usman to claim that Edwards was easy money. “Hey Ali, easy money bro, easy money,” Cejudo said with a chuckle. It wasn’t long before the 35-year-old was made to eat his words. In a video posted to Cejudo’s YouTube channel, you can hear Edwards’ cornerman call for a head kick before the crowd goes wild after he perfectly executes the instruction.

The camera then pans to the audience who are going absolutely wild following one of the most epic come-from-behind wins in MMA history. When the gobsmacked UFC star finally managed to utter some words, he pointed out a technical mistake Usman made before the KO, gave Edwards props, and suggested a rematch will happen next.

Defence is your number one weapon, where you place your head,” Cejudo said. “He [Usman] is going to have to get his rematch. He [Edwards] deserves it, man. That dude waited for so long. He won, man. He won!” According to UFC president Dana White, the plan is to make Edwards vs Usman 3 in the UK later this year. The MMA boss suggested the trilogy fight could take place at Wembley Stadium in London but did express concerns about holding an outdoor show in a country notorious for its bad weather.

       "  'content': 'Jose Enrique has said on Twitter that Tottenham Hotspur left-back Sergio Reguilon would be a good signing for Nottingham Forest in the summer transfer window. The former Liverpool star has said that Reguilon was “unbelievable” during his loan spell at Sevilla from Real Madrid before he moved to Tottenham. The Stadium Astro pundit believes that the 25-year-old Spain international, who can operate as a left-back or as a left wing-back, would be a great signing for Forest, who are playing in the Premier League this season after winning promotion from the Championship. The Athletic reported earlier today that Forest are in talks with Tottenham over signing the left-back on loan until the end of the season.

He was unbelievable at Seville before Madrid sold him to Tottenham. pic.twitter.com/0MqSt9upjt— José enrique (@Jesanchez3) August 22, 2022 In our view, Tottenham Hotspur left-back Sergio Reguilon would be a good signing for Nottingham Forest in the summer transfer window, especially on a loan deal. Reguilon may not be in Tottenham head coach Antonio Conte’s plans, but he has done relatively well in the Premier League and would make Forest better, both in attack and in defence.

       "  'content': 'Tuesday racing tips feature selections from Worcester, Bangor and Fontwell. talkSPORT have gone through the race cards and form so you don’t have to, with betting tips on the UK racing. Festive Glory finished behind Presentandcounting seen here winning at Worcester and that gives him a huge chance on Tuesday afternoonGETTY 888Sport – Bet £10 get £30 + £10 casino – CLAIM HERE* Jump racing is getting back into the swing of things with four meetings around the UK and Ireland, with Bellewstown holding an evening meeting alongside Fontwell. Worcester racing tips 2.30: Festive Glory 6/4 (NAP) Showed some promise novice hurdling at Uttoxeter in June behind Presentandcounting who went on to win by a huge distance so boosts Festive Glory’s chances in this sphere. Going up in trip should suit better than most and has in-form Paddy Brennan on board to get the job done. Bangor racing tips 5.20: Go On Chez 1/1 (NB) This course and distance winner was close to a six timer when chasing but struggled to keep up with the step up in class in July. But a return to this course and distance is ideal while also going down in class again. He should be better off than his main market rival who is running for the second time after a wind op, but at ten-years-old and bottom weight needs to find a bit more to win against this serial winner. 3.15: Al Roc 9/1 The outsider of the field is preferred here as a return to chasing looks to revive winning ways for a busy 11-year-old this summer. He was aimed at a Grade 3 back in July but was pulled up at 25/1 odds and now is dropped back to Class 3 company. The last time he faced this level he ran away a seven length winner over a similar distance at Market Rasen and after disappointing over hurdles between those decent chases still looks in great condition at a big price. Fontwell racing tips 4.30: Geromino 4/5 This match between Geromino and Notre Pari is incredibly close to call, with the former giving just 4lb to his rival. The Donald McCain-trained horse has had tough contests recently including over small fields of two, three and four. But finally things came together over this course when stepping up to 2m4f and won by over six lengths. Now off only a pound higher this odds-on shot looks the one to beat under Theo Gillard who takes off 3lb.

       "  'content': 'Get your briefcase ready…(Pictures: Getty / Rex) Hit comedy-drama series Ally McBeal is being eyed for a reboot at ABC and could see the return of Calista Flockhart as the titular character. The series will be a sequel to the original which first aired in 1997 starring the likes of Courtney Thorne-Smith, Greg Germann, Lisa Nicole Carson, and Jane Krakowski. Written and executive produced by Karin Gist, Deadline reported the new show will follow a young Black woman who joins the law firm from the original series straight out of law school. The lead character is believed to be the daughter of Renée Raddick, Ally’s D.C. roommate. Calista has been rumoured to have been approached to return to the role of Ally for the series, though this has not yet been confirmed. The original series ran until 2002, launching the original ‘dancing baby’ meme which took the internet by storm in its early days. The show is reportedly in development with ABC (Credits: Moviestore / REX / Shutterstock) The show will be a sequel to the original and follow a new leading lady (Picture: Moviestore / REX / Shutterstock) Calista Flockhart could return as Ally (Picture: Greg Gorman / 20th Century Fox / Kobal / REX / Shutterstock) It followed the life of Ally McBeal, a lawyer working in the Boston law firm Cage and Fish, as well as her co-workers. Ally McBeal won the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1999, going on to win a further six during its time on TV. It remains influential two decades since its end, with the creative team behind the latest Marvel series She-Hulk listing it as inspiration for the show. Last year it was reported that another reboot of the show was in early development by 20th Television.
